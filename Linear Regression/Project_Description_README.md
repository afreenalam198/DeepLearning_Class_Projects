The main dataset for this project called cancer_reg.csv can be found in the Dataset folder.  

The goal of this project/challenge is to predict the results of Cancer Mortality Rates.  

Therefore, the label is “TARGET_deathRate”.  

These data were aggregated from a number of sources including the American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov), https://www.clinicaltrials.gov, and https://www.cancer.gov.  

In the past, the best model achieved R-squared of 0.9624.  

For this project I have tried out the following models -  

* Linear Regression
* Deep Fully Connected Networks (DNNs) -
* * DNN-16
  * DNN-30-8
  * DNN-30-16-8
  * DNN-30-16-8-4
