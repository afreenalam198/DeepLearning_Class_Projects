# For Data Preprocessing -  


Since I have used Google Colab for this assignment, my instructions are based on how to run my codes on Google Colab.  

Open Google Colab and upload the Data_Preprocessing.ipynb file.  

Upload the cancer_reg.csv file (uploaded files will be removed if your runtime gets disconnected).  

Run the codes.  

3 csv files will be generated.  

You can download the Train, Validation and Test csv files. I have also included the generated csv files in the zip file.   



# For Running all the models -  

Open Google Colab and upload the model.ipynb file (For Example - DNN_16.ipynb).  

Upload the train_cancer_reg.csv,  validation_cancer_reg.csv and test_cancer_reg.csv files (uploaded files will be removed if your runtime gets disconnected).  

Run the codes.
