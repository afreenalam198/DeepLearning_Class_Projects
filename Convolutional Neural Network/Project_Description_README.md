In this homework you will practice how to write Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python with TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch. You need to understand how CNN works in order to implement this homework successfully.  

The goals of this homework are:  
- To understand the steps to train/test the classifier for image classification.
- Understand architecture of CNN and how to connect each layer together by using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  
Data preview:  

The goal of this project/challenge is to predict handwrite digital numbers between 0-9.  

The dataset description can be found:
